# Enhancing-Web-Application-Security-through-Safe-Client-Side-Storage-Practices

This repository demonstrates a secure approach to storing and retrieving sensitive data (like authentication tokens, profile data, or session information) on the client side of a web application. It contrasts **insecure storage practices** with a **secure wrapper-based design** through a detailed flowchart.  

## 📌 Why This Matters  
Storing data directly in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` without encryption exposes it to attacks like:  
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** – malicious scripts can steal tokens.  
- **Session Hijacking** – compromised tokens allow unauthorized access.  
- **Data Corruption/Loss** – raw values can be tampered with or go missing.  

The secure workflow prevents these issues by enforcing **encryption, expiry validation, and structured payloads** before data is stored or retrieved.  

## 🔑 Workflow Overview  

### Insecure Flow (❌)  
- Directly store raw values in `localStorage`.  
- Data remains unencrypted and vulnerable to attacks.  
- Retrieval may return corrupted, missing, or insecure data.  

### Secure Flow (✅)  
- Use a **secure wrapper** (`setItem`, `getItem`) for all storage operations.  
- Encrypt data and bind it with an expiry timestamp.  
- Store an encrypted JSON payload in `localStorage`.  
- On retrieval, validate expiry, decrypt safely, and return original data.  
- If invalid or expired, return an error instead of insecure values.  

## 🛠 Features of the Secure Wrapper  
- **Transparent API**: works like native `localStorage.setItem/getItem`.  
- **Encryption**: sensitive data is never stored in plaintext.  
- **Auto-expiry**: prevents indefinite persistence of sensitive tokens.  
- **Error handling**: gracefully handles invalid or expired payloads.
